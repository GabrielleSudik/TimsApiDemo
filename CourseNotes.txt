The API Project

Started with a .Net Web App, Core 3.1, API.

Note the boilerplate starts with a WeatherForecast example code.
When you launch, your browser will open with some dummy
weather info (json) at https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast. 
We'll delete WeatherForecast for our class.
Before we do... Check out the Properties for the project,
then Debug tab. Among other things, "Launch Browser" is set to
"weatherforecast", just like the last part of the URL above.
Later, we'll need to change this value to our new work.

-- Add the DLL / Common Project --

Copy the .dll from the Library project, paste it here.
Add it as a reference. Add THIS COPY, not the one in Library.
Then paste the referenes from Library project here too.
In the .csproj file. (Note it seems to open when you select the project.)

-- Configure DI --

Startup.cs -- Configure(): Add the services.Stuff there.

-- Add the Connection String --

appsettings.json. Add:

  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Data Source=(local) ... etc"

Remember the value comes from checking SQL Server Obj Explorer,
and the properties for the TimsDinerDB. ConnetionString value.

-- Routing --

Startup.cs - Configure().
There is no redirect to error pages like the other project.
And the mapping controllers don't have typical paths.
Instead, the routes are set in the controllers instead of 
app.UseEndpoints() the way the other projects do.
More on this in later lessons...

-- Creating Data --
